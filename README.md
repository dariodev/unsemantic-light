## Description

This is a fluid grid system for mobile, tablet, and desktop, entirely based on percentages. This is a fork of [Unsemantic CSS Framework](http://unsemantic.com) by Nathan Smith. I removed Sass, Adapt.js and all the extra code inccluding IE7 support. Unsemantic Light consists of a single file - Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints.
