## Description

This is a fluid grid system for mobile, tablet, and desktop, entirely based on percentages.  
This is a fork of [Unsemantic CSS Framework](http://unsemantic.com) by Nathan Smith. I removed Sass (I refuse to use any preprocessors. But that's another story.), removed Adapt.js and all the extra code including IE7 support. Unsemantic Light consists of a single file - unsemantic-light.css. Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints.
