## Description

Unsemantic Light is a fluid grid system for mobile, tablet, and desktop, entirely based on percentages. This is a fork of [Unsemantic CSS Framework](http://unsemantic.com) by Nathan Smith.  

I removed 99% of the original files. I removed Sass, I refuse to use any CSS preprocessors, but that's another story. Removed Adapt.js and all the extra code including IE7 support.  
Unsemantic Light consists of a single file - unsemantic-light.css. Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop breakpoints.

**Other changes:**
* Fixed Windows Phone scale issue, changed @-ms-viewport, auto instead of 320px.
* Fixed the issue with media queries and browser zoom using the exact same values for both min-width and max-width.
